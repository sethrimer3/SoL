# SoL (Speed of Light) - Game Design Document

## Overview
SoL is a 2D real-time strategy game set in space with cross-platform support for mobile and desktop.

## Core Concept
Players engage in space battles around stars/suns, utilizing light mechanics and ray tracing for strategic gameplay.

## Factions
Three distinct races with unique characteristics:
1. **Radiant** - Light-focused civilization
2. **Aurum** - Gold/wealth-oriented faction
3. **Solari** - Sun-worshipping empire

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Main Base: Stellar Forge
- Primary structure for each player
- Produces units when supplied with Solarium
- Critical structure - loss results in defeat
- Must receive light from Solar Mirrors to function

### Resource System: Solarium (Sol)
- Primary currency/resource
- Generated by Solar Mirrors reflecting sunlight to the Stellar Forge
- Used for unit production and building construction
- Production rate depends on light intensity received

### Solar Mirrors
- Resource collection structures
- Reflect light from sun(s) to the Stellar Forge
- Require clear line-of-sight to:
  1. A light source (sun/star)
  2. The Stellar Forge (base)
- Can be targeted by enemies to disrupt economy

### Light & Shadow System
- Uses ray tracing for realistic light propagation
- Objects cast shadows in space
- Shadows block solar mirror efficiency
- Strategic positioning crucial for resource flow
- Multiple suns create complex light patterns

### Unit Production
- Units produced at Stellar Forge
- Requires:
  1. Sufficient Solarium
  2. Active light connection (mirror → forge)
- Production halts when light is blocked

## Victory Conditions
- Destroy enemy Stellar Forge
- Economic domination
- Control key strategic positions

## Technical Features
- 2D graphics with ray-traced lighting
- Cross-platform (Mobile & Desktop)
- Real-time multiplayer with crossplay
- AI opponents

## Game Flow
1. Players start with Stellar Forge and initial Solar Mirrors
2. Position mirrors to maximize light collection
3. Accumulate Solarium
4. Produce units
5. Attack enemy positions and mirrors
6. Protect own resource infrastructure
7. Destroy enemy Stellar Forge to win
