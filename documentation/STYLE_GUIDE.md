# SoL Style Guide

## Menu Presentation

### Particle Typography & UI Forms
- Menu words, headings, and key text should be rendered as particle clusters that form clean, readable glyphs.
- Menu UI containers (buttons, cards, carousel tiles) should be expressed as particle outlines rather than solid fills.
- Particle clusters must be sampled evenly across glyph shapes and borders to avoid sparse or clumped regions.

### Menu Transitions
- When changing menus, the existing particles should reflow smoothly into the new layout rather than disappearing.
- Motion should feel weightless and cohesive: particles glide into their new positions with gentle easing.

### Resting Motion
- Once settled, particles should maintain a subtle, smooth drift in place.
- Drift should be low-amplitude to avoid distracting from menu readability.

### Main Menu
- The main menu uses particle typography for the title, subtitle, and descriptive copy.
- Carousel cards and helper prompts should be represented by particle outlines and text clusters.
